# Heart-disease-prediction-using-ML
The working of Machine Learning Algorithms can be an important tool in the future for an advanced Health care environment and for providing cost-effective predictive results. I have used 3 Datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and applied different Machine Learning Techniques such as - Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM Classifier, Random Search Forest Classifier, Naive Bayes, and Gradient Boosting Classifier. Here, we can compare the results among 3 different models created after applying different Feature selection techniques such as forward feature selection (Wrapper Method), and PSO method (Nature inspired Feature Selection).
